The Group Registration plugin for LearnDash allows Group leaders to purchase a course (or courses) on behalf of multiple students, and then enroll them to the course (or courses), by adding them as group members.

== Description ==
1. Group Leaders and Users have an option to purchase multiple copies/licenses of a single course during a single checkout.
2. A group is automatically created for the course which has been purchased in bulk, and the user making the purchase is set as the Group Leader.
3. Group Leaders have the option to enroll and unenroll multiple students for the courses they purchase, right from the front-end
4. Using the Pro Panel extension for LearnDash, Group Leaders can track user progress.
5. Admins can add multiple users as Group Leaders for a group created and can add or remove students from the group as well.

== Installation ==
Kindly note: The Group Registration plugin is an extension to LearnDash and WooCommerce. You will need to install and activate both these plugins along with the LD-WooCommerce Integration plugin.

1. Upon purchasing the Group Registration plugin, an email will be sent to the registered email id, with the download link for the plugin and a purchase receipt id. Download the plugin using the download link.
2. Go to Plugin-> Add New menu in your dashboard and click on the ‘Upload’ tab. Choose the downloaded plugin file to be uploaded and click on ‘Install Now’.
3. After the plugin has installed successfully, click on the Activate Plugin link or activate the plugin from your Plugins page.
4. An Group Registration for LearnDash License sub-menu will be created under Plugins menu in your dashboard. Click on this menu and enter your purchased product’s license key. Click on Activate License. If license is valid, an ‘Active’ status message will be displayed, else ‘Inactive’ will be displayed.
5. Upon entering a valid license key, and activating the license, you will find a ‘Course Author’ user role created, and ‘Course Creation Settings’ menu added to LearnDash settings.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Does the LD Group Registration plugin have any prerequisites?
Yes, you would need the WooCommerce plugin along with the LD-WooCommerce integration plugin to use the Group Registration plugin.

What will happen if my license expires?
Every purchased license is valid for one year from the date of purchase. During this time you will receive free updates and support. If the license expires, you will still be able to use the plugin, but you will not receive any support or updates.

I was using the plugin on my test site. Now, I need to activate the license on the live site. What do I do?
Don’t stress. Deactivate the license key from the staging site, by going to the Group Registration License sub-menu, and clicking on ‘Deactivate License’. You can then activate it on your live site and it should work fine.
