== Description ==

The LearnDash Review, Rating, and Feedback extension adds a complete, in-house review and rating functionality to your LearnDash website. It eliminates the need to install a separate, external review and rating plugin for WordPress. Users can add comprehensive reviews and send feedback for the courses they have enrolled in, through a quick and easy star-based rating system.
